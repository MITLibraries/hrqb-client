# HR Quickbase (HRQB) Client

A python CLI application for managing data in the Library HR [Quickbase](https://www.quickbase.com/) instance.

## Overview

Library HR uses [Quickbase](https://www.quickbase.com/) to manage and report on employee data.  This application is responsible for 
extracting data from the Data Warehouse, extracting data from data managed by Library HR, transforming this to a data model pre-established
in Quickbase, and loading that data.  This CLI application serves as a simple pipeline to perform this work.

This pipeline will be a Python CLI application, with commands applicable to the data loads and management tasks required, that run on a 
schedule as an ECS container in AWS via EventBridge rules.

- To update dependencies: `make update`
- To run unit tests: `make test`
- To lint the repo: `make lint`
- To run the app: `pipenv run hrqb --help`

## Environment variables

### Required

```shell

LUIGI_CONFIG_PATH=hrqb/luigi.cfg # this env var must be set, pointing to config file in hrqb folder
QUICKBASE_API_URL=# Quickbase API base URL
QUICKBASE_API_TOKEN=# Quickbase API token
QUICKBASE_APP_ID=# Quickbase App ID

```

### Optional

```shell
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH # used when developing on arm64 architecture + Rosetta2 environment
TARGETS_DIRECTORY=# Location to store Task Targets, overriding application default of "output"
